# Logstash Configuration

# This is the main configuration file for Logstash itself (not the pipeline)
# It controls how Logstash runs, not what it does with logs

# HTTP API settings for monitoring Logstash
http.host: "0.0.0.0"
http.port: 9600

# Pipeline settings
# These control how Logstash processes your logs
pipeline:
  # Number of worker threads
  # More workers = higher throughput but more CPU usage
  workers: 2

  # How many events to process in each batch
  # Larger batches = better throughput but higher memory usage
  batch.size: 125

  # How long to wait for a full batch before processing
  # Lower values = faster processing but possibly smaller batches
  batch.delay: 50

# Logging configuration for Logstash itself
# This controls how Logstash logs its own operations
log.level: info
path.logs: /usr/share/logstash/logs

# Disable X-Pack monitoring if you're not using it
# X-Pack is Elastic's commercial monitoring solution
xpack.monitoring.enabled: false

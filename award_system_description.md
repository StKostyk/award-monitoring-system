I am currently developing an **award monitoring and tracking system** for managing awards that have already been approved and granted in real life. These awards originate from a wide range of sources—departments, faculties, universities, city or oblast administrations, national organizations (Ukraine), international bodies, as well as professional courses, seminars, and meetings. The system is fully **transparent**: there are no private accounts or hidden awards. Every user can view the awards of any other user, department or faculty. **Scanned diplomas or certificates** can optionally be attached to awards and are stored in user (or department/faculty/university) profiles, making them publicly visible. Department, faculty and university profiles are run by department chair/department secretary, dean/faculty secretary and rector/rector's secretary respectively (but also it can be a regular employee if they have the right to manage such account from a higher role).

To ensure **data integrity and transparency**, the system maintains detailed **version history and audit logs** for all awards and requests, recording who made what changes and when. It enforces robust **data validation rules** to prevent duplicate entries, ensure award dates fall within valid ranges, and maintain consistent metadata. Given the sensitive nature of scanned documents, the platform incorporates **GDPR-compliant consent mechanisms**, configurable **data retention policies**, and options for **auto-archival or deletion** based on role-defined retention periods.

The system supports a range of **user roles**—employees, faculty secretaries (acting as reviewers), deans, rector's secretaries, rector, system maintenance managers, and more. Each role is granted specific scopes and permissions: for example, secretaries can approve departmental awards, deans oversee faculty-level activity, and rectors manage university-wide oversight. Reviewers can be **reassigned or delegated** if unavailable, and all role-specific actions are logged. Users access **customizable dashboards** with widgets like “My Pending Requests,” “Awards This Month,” or “Department Trends,” enabling personalized overviews of relevant metrics.

**Notifications** are fully configurable, offering **tiered alerts** via email, in-app, or SMS for events such as submission approvals, rejections, escalations, and upcoming deadlines. The system triggers **reminders** when review periods exceed configured limits, and employees can **flag parsing errors** in award data before final submission. A built-in **feedback and appeal mechanism** lets employees contest rejections, opening a secondary review workflow when necessary.

Awards enter the system through two pathways. First, authorized roles (dean, rector, or reviewer) can manually input or upload award information. A **configurable parser** automatically extracts metadata from uploaded files, flags low-confidence fields for manual review, and learns over time to improve **auto-categorization** (e.g., suggesting tags like "research," "innovation") as well as it has "confidence threshold" settings (e.g., auto-reject parses below 80% accuracy). Second, an employee can create a **new award request**, which moves through the review workflow. Rejected requests can be **edited and resubmitted**, and if left unattended, they **expire after a defined period** with automated reminder notifications.

The **review workflow** supports **multi-level approvals**, routing requests from department to faculty to university levels as needed. Faculty secretaries can approve or escalate independently; rectors and their secretaries handle university-level decisions. To prevent conflicting changes, the system implements **edit-locking and collision detection**, highlighting discrepancies side-by-side and offering **AI-driven conflict suggestions** (e.g., recommending the most recent date entry). Reviewers can also process **batch approvals or rejections** to expedite high-volume workloads.

A robust **policy engine** governs processing rules—defining review periods (X), resubmission windows (Y), escalation timelines, and archival policies. Policies are organized into **role-specific templates** (for example, "International Awards: 7-day review") and stored in versioned logs for auditability. Administrators may test changes in a **policy sandbox** before deployment, and higher-level roles can revert policies to prior versions.

The platform’s **reporting and analytics** suite delivers actionable insights: **trend analysis** charts award distribution over time, **recognition heatmaps** highlight top-performing departments, and **reviewer performance dashboards** track metrics like average decision time and backlog levels. Reports support exports to PDF/CSV with flexible filters by award category, department, date range, and more.

**Employee management** integrates seamlessly with award tracking. Employees can be onboarded by parsing HR documents or manual entry by authorized roles. During registration, users link their accounts to employee profiles either via matching corporate email or a **confirmation workflow** managed by deans or secretaries. Employee statuses (active, inactive, retired and memorial for deceased) control access to the system and preserve historical data for former staff. An **organization hierarchy module** enables admins to manage departments and faculties, and supports **bulk CSV imports** and real-time **API integrations** with HR platforms.

Designed for **scalability and resilience**, all awards and requests undergo **automated archival** after configurable retention periods. The system includes comprehensive **disaster recovery** measures—scheduled backups of databases and scanned documents, with documented restore procedures. **Webhooks and REST APIs** facilitate seamless data syncing with external systems, while a **mobile-responsive UI** ensures smooth performance on smartphones and tablets.

**Additional engagement and polish features** enrich the user experience. Public **Award Verification Badges** highlight awards with verified scanned documents, and **endorsements** let deans or rectors publicly commend notable achievements. An **Award Impact Score** algorithmically ranks awards by source and level. New users can access **interactive tutorials** and an **embedded help center** with searchable guides, GIFs, and videos. Finally, the platform adheres to **WCAG accessibility standards**, offering screen-reader support, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast modes for all users.
